### this will be a file where I will put all spectral line fitting code

### I will have three independent methods of fitting gaussian peaks

### I am sure I will be able to find these on other people's github

### The methods are: Markov-Chain methods - explore the parameter space about the different peaks (mu and sigma)
### Least Squares - simple but a good comparison


### return line flux, equivalent width, SNR, Central Wavelength
### include pyneb to get abundances
# que is an emission line code that i could look at - or use to compare with what i have written
